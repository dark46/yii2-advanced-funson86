==========

Backend user & password:
Login: `admin`
Password: `qwe1234`

Installation and getting started:
---------------------------------

If you do not have Composer, you may install it by following the instructions at getcomposer.org.

1. Run the following command: `php composer.phar create-project --stability=dev funson86/yii2-advanced-funson86 yii2-advanced` to install Yii2-Advanced-funson86.
2. Run command: `cd /my/path/to/yii2-advanced/` and go to main application directory.
3. Run command: `php requirements.php` and check the requirements.
4. Run command: `php init` to initialize the application with a specific environment.
5. Create a new database and adjust it configuration in `common/config/main-local.php` accordingly.
6. Run command: `yii migrate` to apply migrations with console commands:
   - m140608_201405_user_init : user table
7. Run commond: `yii migrate --migrationPath=@funson86/auth/migrations` to apply https://github.com/funson86/yii2-auth
8. This will create tables needed for the application to work.
9. You also can use database dump from `my/path/to/yii2-advanced/tests/yii2-advanced-funson86.sql`, but however I recommend to use migrations.
10. You also can download from http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kT6FsoB, and the sql file is in the root path.
